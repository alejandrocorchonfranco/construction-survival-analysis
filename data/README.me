# Synthetic Construction Sector Dataset

This repository contains a **synthetic dataset** generated from the original *SABI_Export_Construccion* file, which was used for econometric modelling and survival analysis in the Spanish construction sector. The synthetic version enables **reproducibility**, **open-science practices**, and **code verification** while ensuring that no sensitive or identifiable information is disclosed.

## About the Synthetic Data

The synthetic dataset was generated using:
- Empirical distributions for categorical variables
- Approximate Gaussian distributions for continuous variables
- Range-preserving transformations to ensure numerical plausibility

No rows correspond to any original company, and no variable contains real values.  
The dataset is designed for **methodological reproduction**, not for economic inference.
